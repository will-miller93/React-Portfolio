# Hello! 
My name is Will Miller. I am a youngling developer with an eye for functional, elegant design.

I attended the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Georgia Tech in the spring of 2018. It was there that I really found a love for programming and development. Since then I have participated in Hackathons and actually managed to win one! I have also been doing a lot of projects that have expanded my knowledge of programming and has grown the list of technologies I can use. 

 I love all facets of development and am currently seeking full time employment with a company that I can build a career at. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and if you have any questions feel free to email me!
